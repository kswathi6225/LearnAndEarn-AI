# Learn & Earn AI

## Project Overview
Learn & Earn AI is a Python-based learning platform designed to help users improve skills and track their learning progress. The application focuses on handling and processing structured user data related to learning activities and presenting the information in a clear and understandable format.

The project demonstrates basic data handling, backend logic, and data presentation using Python-based tools.

---

## Problem Statement
Many learners struggle to track skill development and understand their progress in a structured way. There is a need for simple systems that can process learning-related data and present meaningful information to users to support better decision-making.

---

## Solution
Learn & Earn AI addresses this by:
- Collecting user learning-related data
- Processing and organizing structured datasets
- Displaying outputs in a clear and user-friendly format
- Supporting basic analysis of user progress

The focus of the project is on **data handling, validation, and presentation** rather than advanced automation.

---

## Key Features
- Skill learning and progress tracking
- Structured data handling using Python
- Clear presentation of outputs using a web interface
- Backend logic implementation and debugging

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – core backend logic and data processing  
- **Pandas** – handling and working with datasets  
- **Streamlit** – displaying outputs in a simple web interface  
- **Firebase** – basic storage of user-related data  
- **GitHub** – version control and collaboration
