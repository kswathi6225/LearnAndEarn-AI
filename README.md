# Learn & Earn AI

> This project is intended to demonstrate data handling, reporting, and dashboard support skills for analytics-focused roles.

## Project Overview
Learn & Earn AI is a Python-based learning platform designed to help users improve skills and track their learning progress. The application focuses on collecting, handling, and processing structured user data related to learning activities, and presenting the information in a clear and understandable format.

The project demonstrates basic data handling, backend logic, and data presentation using Python-based tools.

## Problem Statement
Many learners find it difficult to track skill development and understand their progress in a structured manner. There is a need for simple systems that can process learning-related data and present meaningful information to users to support better understanding and decision-making.

---

## Solution
Learn & Earn AI addresses this problem by:
- Collecting user learning-related data
- Processing and organizing structured datasets
- Validating data for correctness
- Displaying outputs in a clear and user-friendly format
- Supporting basic analysis of user progress

The primary focus of the project is on **data handling, validation, and presentation**, rather than advanced automation or predictive systems.

---

## Key Features
- Skill learning and progress tracking
- Structured data handling using Python
- Clear presentation of processed data through a web interface
- Backend logic implementation, testing, and debugging

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – core backend logic and data processing  
- **Pandas** – handling and working with structured datasets  
- **Streamlit** – displaying outputs in a simple web interface  
- **Firebase** – basic storage of user-related data  
- **Tableau (Basic / Exploratory)** – explored for visualizing sample project data to understand dashboard-based reporting  
- **GitHub** – version control and collaboration
